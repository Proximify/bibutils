Abstract = {{Accumulation of oxidative stress in cells is an essential feature of
   cellular senescence and aging. This phenomenon is involved in different
   age-related diseases through dysregulation of homeostasis and impairing
   repair and regeneration (wound healing) capacity, which can suppress
   antioxidant responses such as the activity of antioxidant enzymes and
   damaged protein clearance system. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
   factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor which regulates basal and
   inducible expression pattern of specific genes (antioxidants and
   detoxifications) through antioxidant element response (ARE) sites in the
   stress condition, specifically in chronic and age-related stresses. Nrf2
   maintains cellular redox hemostasis and promotes rejuvenation. Exosomes
   are nanoscale vesicles that are released by various cells to actively
   regulate the complex cellular signaling networks. Exosomal-Nrf2 and
   exosomal-Nrf2-mediated products can modulate oxidative hemostasis in
   target cells to induce tissue repairing with therapeutic proposes, and
   regeneration capability. In this study, we summarized the role of
   exosomal-Nrf2 in different age-related diseases, including diabetic foot
   ulcers, atherosclerosis, chronic heart failure, reproductive cell
   failures, and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we briefly
   explained the crosstalk between plant exosomes and mammalian cell
   metabolism in the benefit of cellular stress suppression. (C) 2020

Title = {{Analysis of RNA binding properties of human Ku protein reveals its

Abstract = {{Human Ku heterodimeric protein composed of Ku70 and Ku80 subunits plays
   an important role in the non-homologous end-joining DNA repair pathway
   as a sensor of double strand DNA breaks. Ku is also involved in numerous
   cellular processes, and in some of them it acts in an RNA-dependent
   manner. However, RNA binding properties of the human Ku have not been
   well studied. Here we have analyzed interactions of a recombinant Ku
   heterodimer with a set of RNAs of various structure as well as eCLIP
   (enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) data for human Ku70. As
   a result, we have proposed a consensus RNA structure preferable for the
   Ku binding that is a hairpin possessing a bulge just near GpG
   sequence-containing terminal loop. 7SK snRNA is a scaffold for a
   ribonucleoprotein complex (7SK snRNP), which is known to participate in
   transcription regulation. We have shown that the recombinant Ku
   specifically binds a G-rich loop of hairpin 1 within 7SK snRNA.
   Moreover, Ku protein has been co-precipitated from HEK 293T cells with
   endogenous 7SK snRNA and such proteins included in 7SK snRNP as HEXIM1,
   Cdk9 and CTIP2. Ku and Cdk9 binding is found to be RNA-independent,
   meanwhile HEXIM1 and Ku co-precipitation depended on the presence of
   intact 7SK snRNA. The latter result has been confirmed using recombinant
   HEXIM1 and Ku proteins. Colocalization of Ku and CTIP2 was additionally
   confirmed by confocal microscopy. These results allow us to propose
   human Ku as a new component of the 7SK snRNP complex. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dihydropyrimidinase is a member of the cyclic amidohydrolase family,
   which also includes allantoinase, dihydroorotase, hydantoinase, and
   imidase. This enzyme is important in pyrimidine metabolism, and blocking
   its activity would be detrimental to cell survival. This study
   investigated the dihydropyrimidinase inhibition by plumbagin isolated
   from the extract of carnivorous plant Nepenthes miranda (Nm). Plumbagin
   inhibited dihydropyrimidinase with IC50 value of 58 +/- 3 mu M. Double
   reciprocal results of Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that this compound
   is a competitive inhibitor of dihydropyrimidinase. Fluorescence
   quenching analysis revealed that plumbagin could form a stable complex
   with dihydropyrimidinase with the K-d value of 37.7 +/- 1.4 mu M.
   Docking experiments revealed that the dynamic loop crucial for
   stabilization of the intermediate state in dihydropyrimidinase might be
   involved in the inhibition effect of plumbagin. Mutation at either Y155
   or K156 within the dynamic loop of dihydropyrimidinase caused low
   plumbagin binding affinity. In addition to their dihydropyrimidinase
   inhibition, plumbagin and Nm extracts also exhibited cytotoxicity on
   melanoma cell survival, migration, and proliferation. Further research
   can directly focus on designing compounds that target the dynamic loop
   in dihydropyrimidinase during catalysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and

Abstract = {{The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins play a vital
   role in genome stability and chromosome organization in all domains of
   life. Previous reports show that smc deletion causes decondensation of
   chromosome and an increased frequency of anucleated cells in bacteria.
   However, smc deletion in both Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis did not affect chromosome condensation or the frequency of
   anucleated cells. In an attempt to understand this difference in M.
   smegmatis, we investigated the function of MksB (MsMksB), an alternate
   SMC-like protein. Like other bacterial SMCs, MsMksB is also an elongated
   homodimer, in which a central hinge domain connects two globular ATPase
   head domains via two coiled-coil arms. We show that full-length MsMksB
   binds to different topological forms of DNA without any preferences.
   However, the hinge and headless domains prefer binding to
   single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA),
   respectively. The binding of MsMksB to DNA was independent of ATP as its
   ATP hydrolysis deficient mutant was also proficient in DNA binding.
   Further, the cytological profiling studies revealed that only the
   full-length MsMksB and none of its structural domains could condense the
   bacterial chromosome. This observation indicates the plausibility of the
   concerted action of different structural domains of SMC to bind and
   condense the chromosome. Moreover, MsMksB exhibited DNA stimulated
   ATPase activity, in addition to its intrinsic ATPase activity. Taken
   together, we have elucidated the function of an alternate bacterial
   condensin protein MksB and its structural domains in DNA binding and
   condensation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie

Abstract = {{The importance of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-derived arachidonic acid (AA)
   metabolites, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) and
   epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) as tumor growth promotors has already
   been described in several cancer types. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the role of these compounds in the biology of
   pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. These tumors originate from chromaffin
   cells derived from adrenal medulla (pheochromocytomas) or extra-adrenal
   autonomic paraganglia (paragangliomas), and they represent the most
   common hereditary endocrine neoplasia. According to mutations in the
   driver genes, these tumors are divided in two clusters: pseudo-hypoxic
   and kinase-signaling
   EETs, but not 20-HETE, exhibited a potent ability to sustain growth in a
   murine pheochromocytoma cell line (MPC) in vitro, EETs promoted an
   increase in cell proliferation and a decrease in cell apoptosis. In a
   mouse model of pheochromocytoma, the inhibition of CYP-mediated AA
   metabolism using 1-aminobenzotriazol resulted in slower tumor growth, a
   decreased vascularization, and a lower final volume. Also, the
   expression of AA-metabolizing CYP monooxygenases was detected in tumor
   samples from human origin, being their apparent abundance and the
   production of both metabolites higher in tumors from the
   kinase-signaling cluster.
   This is the first evidence of the importance of CYP- derived AA

Abstract = {{Many natural phyto-products as perezone (Per) exhibit anti-cancer
   activities. Using experimental and computational studies, it was
   described that Poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1(PARP-1) inhibition and the
   induction of oxidative stress state explain the pro-apoptotic activity
   of Per. The aim of this study was to evaluate two phyto-products related
   to Per as anti-cancer agents: hydroxyperezone (OHPer) and its
   monoangelate (OHPer-MAng). These molecules were structurally
   characterized employing thermal analysis, IR spectrophotometry and X-ray
   diffraction techniques. The phyto-compounds evaluated in vitro in six
   cancer cell lines (K562, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, U373, A549) and
   non-malignant cells determinate their cytotoxicity, type of induced cell
   death, ability to avoid cell migration and changes at the redox status
   of the cell. Using, in vitro and computational studies provided the
   inhibition of PARP-1 and its potential binding mode. Cell proliferation
   assays demonstrated that OHPer-MAng treatment significantly induces
   apoptosis in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line (MDA-MB-231
   IC50 = 3.53 mu M), being particularly less cytotoxic to Vero cells (IC50
   = 313.92 mu M), human lymphocytes (IC50 = 221.46 mu M) and rat
   endothelial cells (IC50 => 400 mu M). The treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells
   with OHPer-MAng showed inhibition of migration by cancer cells. The
   induction of an oxidative stress state, similar to other quinones and
   PARP-1 inhibition explains the pro-apoptotic activity of OHPer-MAng.
   Docking studies showed that OHPer-MAng establishes great non-bonding
   interactions with the lateral chains of Tyr235, Hys201, Tyr246, Ser203,
   Asn207, and Gly233 located at the catalytic site of PARP-1, also
   demonstrating the anti-cancer activity of OHPer-MAng in TNBC cell line.

Abstract = {{A gradual truncation of the primary structure of frog skin-derived Huia
   versabilis Bowman-Birk peptidic inhibitor (HV-BBI) resulted in 18-times
   stronger inhibitor of matriptase-1 (peptide 6, K-i = 8 nM) in comparison
   to the full-length HV-BBI (K-i = 155 nM). Analogous increase in the
   inhibitory activity in correlation with the peptide length reduction was
   not observed in case of other serine proteases, bovine trypsin (K-i =
   151 nM for peptide 6 and K-i = 120 nM for HV-BBI) and plasmin (K-i = 120
   nM for peptide 6 and 82 nM for HV-BBI). Weaker binding affinity to these
   enzymes emphasized an inhibitory specificity of peptide 6. Molecular
   dynamic analysis revealed that the observed variations in the binding
   affinity of peptide 6 and HV-BBI with matriptase-1 are associated with
   the entropic differences of the unbound peptides. Moreover, several
   aspects explaining differences in the inhibition of matriptase-1 by
   peptide 6 (bearing the C-terminal amide group) and its two analogues,
   peptide 6{*} (having the C-terminal carboxyl group, K-i = 473 nM) and
   cyclic peptide 6{*}{*} (K-i = 533 nM), both exhibiting more than 50-fold
   reduced inhibitory potency, were discovered. It was also shown that
   peptide 6 presented significantly higher resistance to proteolytic
   degradation in human serum than HV-BBI. Additional investigations
   revealed that, in contrast to some amphibian-derived inhibitors, HV-BBI
   and its truncated analogues do not possess bactericidal activity, thus
   they cannot be considered as bifunctional agents. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{High urinary excretion and tissue accumulation of 3-methylglutaric acid
   (MGA) are observed in patients affected by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric
   (HMGA) and 3-methylglutaconic (MGTA) acidurias. The pathomechanisms
   underlying the hepatic dysfunction commonly observed in these disorders
   are not fully elucidated so that we investigated here the effects of
   intraperitoneal administration of MGA on redox homeostasis,
   mitochondrial bioenergetics, biogenesis and dynamics in rat liver. The
   effects of a pretreatment with the protective compound bezafibrate (BEZ)
   were also determined. Our data showed that MGA induced lipid
   peroxidation and altered enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant
   defenses in liver, indicating redox homeostasis disruption. BEZ
   prevented most of these alterations induced by MGA. MGA also decreased
   the activities of the respiratory chain complexes II and IV and
   increased of II-III, whereas BEZ prevented the alteration in complex II
   activity. Furthermore, MGA decreased levels of nuclear PGC-1 alpha and
   Sirt1, and increased levels of AMPK alpha 1 and cytosolic PPAR gamma,
   which were blocked by BEZ. MGA augmented the levels of mitofusin-1 and
   dynamin-related protein 1, suggesting that both fusion and fission
   mitochondrial processes are enhanced by MGA. BEZ was able to prevent
   only the changes in mitofusin-1 levels. Collectively, these findings
   indicate that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are
   mechanisms involved in the hepatic dysfunction found in HMGA and MGTA.
   It is also presumed that mitochondrial biogenesis stimulation may
   constitute an attractive approach to reduce MGA toxicity in liver of

Abstract = {{ER is a highly specialized complex of branched microtubules enclosed in
   a membrane and communicating with each other, its functions in the cell
   are important and very diverse: lipid and phospholipid synthesis,
   calcium storage, hormone synthesis, protein synthesis and maturation,
   membrane production, toxin neutralization, etc. The high concentration
   of calcium ions and the oxidizing properties of the contents of the ER
   cavities contribute to the proper synthesis and folding of proteins
   designed for secretion or exposure on the surface of the cell membrane.
   However, disturbance of redox regulation can lead to the accumulation of
   improperly folded proteins in the ER, disruption of calcium regulation,
   which can cause ER-stress. This review is devoted to the role of
   ER-resident selenoproteins in the processes occurring in this organelle
   of a cell. The main emphasis is placed on the study of protein-protein
   interactions of selenoproteins with their physiological partners; this
   will facilitate understanding of their functional purpose in this
   organelle. Currently, 7 selenoproteins are known that are localized in
   the ER, but the functions of most of them are not at all clear, for
   some, physiological partners have been identified. It is known that
   selenoproteins are oxidoreductases with antioxidant properties, this is
   extremely important for the normal functioning of ER. Therefore, this
   review can be very useful for understanding the full picture of the
   functions of ER-resident selenoproteins obtained on the basis of recent
   data. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et
