Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating auto-immune disease of the
   central nervous system with a suspected genetic component.
   Previous publications have demonstrated that MS susceptibility is
   influenced by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes and recent
   studies have focused on additional susceptibility genes. The
   accumulation of activated T-cells in demyelinating MS lesions, the
   possible auto-immune mechanism of this disease and the functional
   relationship between MHC and T cell receptor (TCR) molecules support the
   hypothesis that TCR genes are good candidates to influence MS
   development. Published results in this domain are conflicting and still
   a matter of controversy.
   In the present study we analysed the influence of Vbeta, Cbeta,
   PlambdaG3 and Vgamma gene polymorphisms defined by Restriction Fragments
   Length Polymorphism (RFLP) on 48 pairs of monozygotic and dizygotic
   twins with at least one of each pair affected, and also in 63 unrelated
   MS patients for Vgamma gene polymorphism. These results have been
   compared with those in the non affected twins and with data from a
   control group (Beall et al., 1989) regarding Cbeta and Vbeta
   polymorphisms and with a local control population for Vgamma. No
   significant correlation between Cbeta, Vgamma or PlambdaG3 polymorphisms
   and MS was found, only a non significant tendency to reduced PlambdaG3
   allele sharing among dizygotic non concordant twin pairs was observed.
   However one Vbeta11, 25 kb allele and a haplotype defined by Vbeta11 and
   Cbeta alleles showed a correlation with MS susceptibility of borderline
   significance.
   These observations are in favor of a slight effect of a genetic factor
   in the TCRbeta gene region in MS genetic susceptibility whereas this is
   not the case for Vgamma genes.}},
