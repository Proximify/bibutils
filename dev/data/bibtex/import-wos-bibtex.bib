Abstract = {{Oxidative folding of proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is
   critical for the proper sorting and secretion of insulin from pancreatic
   beta-cells. Here, by using non-cell-based insulin aggregation assays and
   mouse insulinoma-derived MIN6 cells, we searched for a candidate
   molecular chaperone for (pro)insulin when its oxidative folding is
   compromised. We found that interaction between insulin and calreticulin
   (CRT), a lectin that acts as an ER-resident chaperone, was enhanced by
   reductive stress in MIN6 cells. Co-incubation of insulin with
   recombinant CRT prevented reductant-induced aggregation of insulin.
   Furthermore, lysosomal degradation of proinsulin, which was facilitated
   by dithiothreitol-induced reductive stress, depended on CRT in MIN6
   cells. Together, our results suggest that CRT may be a protective
   molecule against (pro)insulin aggregation when oxidative folding is
   defective, e.g. under reductive stress conditions, in vitro and in
   cultured cells. Because CRT acts as a molecular chaperone for not only
   glycosylated proteins but also non-glycosylated polypeptides, we also
   propose that (pro)insulin is a novel candidate client of the chaperone
   function of CRT. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de

Title = {{Critical parameters in surface plasmon resonance biosensor development:
   The interaction between estrogen receptor and estrogen response element
   as model}},
Journal = {{BIOCHIMIE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{12-20}},
Month = {{APR-MAY}},
Abstract = {{Estrogenic compounds are contaminants that may be active at low
   concentrations and are a major concern for environmental quality. They
   interact with organisms via Estrogen Receptors (ER). Some detection
   methods which have been developed use the ability of ER to interact with
   short consensus DNA sequences known as Estrogen Response Elements (ERE).
   Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based techniques allow detection of
   interaction without labelled molecule use. Such optical transductors are
   widely used to convert the biological recognition signals into electric
   quantifiable signals. In this study, SPR is used to assess signal
   variation in the presence of estrogenic compounds. The combination of
   physical properties and biological recognition events (e.g. ER/ERE)
   permits the development of biosensors. These require several steps:
   activation of the surface, DNA sequence binding, ERE sequence
   evaluation, ER preparation, characterization of binding properties and
   regeneration of the surface. This article focuses on the mode of surface
   activation, protein-DNA binding conditions and the regeneration of ERE.
   After giving a summary of the literature concerning the usual conditions
   employed in these steps, an evaluation of some key parameters is given.

Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{23-30}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases are allosterically regulated by
   metabolites that are key intermediates of central pathways in the
   respective microorganism. Pyruvate (Pyr) and fructose 6-phosphate
   (Fru6P) activate the enzyme from Agrobacterium tumefaciens by increasing
   V-max about 10- and 20-fold, respectively. Here, we studied the combined
   effect of both metabolites on the enzyme activation. Our results support
   a model in which there is a synergistic binding of these two activators
   to two distinct sites and that each activator leads the enzyme to
   distinct active forms with different properties. In presence of both
   activators, Pyr had a catalytically dominant effect over Fru6P
   determining the active conformational state. By mutagenesis we obtained
   enzyme variants still sensitive to Pyr activation, but in which the
   allosteric signal by Fru6P was disrupted. This indicated that the
   activation mechanism for each effector was not the same. The ability for
   this enzyme to have more than one allosteric activator site, active
   forms, and allosteric signaling mechanisms is critical to expand the
   evolvability of its regulation. These synergistic interactions between
   allosteric activators may represent a feature in other allosteric
   enzymes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et

Volume = {{171}},

Abstract = {{Although up to 25\% of glucose released into circulation in the
   postabsorptive state comes from renal gluconeogenesis, the regulatory
   mechanisms of this process are still poorly recognized, comparing to
   hepatic ones. The aim of the present study was to examine if
   hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) might be involved in the regulation
   of glucose de novo synthesis in kidneys. It was found that HK-2 cells
   (immortalized human kidney proximal tubules, capable of
   gluconeogenesis/glycogen synthesis) cultured with gluconeogenic
   substrates either in hypoxia (1\% O-2) or in the presence of DMOG (an
   inhibitor of HIF-1 alpha degradation) exhibited increased glycogen
   content. This phenomenon was not correlated with augmented glucose
   intake and the effects were reversed by echinomycin (an inhibitor of
   HIF-1 binding to HRE sequence). As concluded from the measurement of the
   intracellular content of gluconeogenic intermediates followed by Western
   blot analysis, under conditions of hypoxia/increased HIF-1 level the
   activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was elevated, as a
   result of increased expression of the cytosolic isoform of PEPCK
   (PEPCK-C). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis proved HIF-1
   ability to bind to the promoter region of PEPCK-C gene. The final
   conclusion that hypoxia/HIF-1 accelerates the rate of renal glucogenesis
   via the mechanism engaging activation of PEPCK-C expression might be
   useful in terms of e.g. diabetes treatment, as it is commonly accepted
   that under diabetic conditions kidneys and liver seem to be equally
   important sources of glucose synthesized de novo. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{As no crystal structure of full-size MutL bound to DNA has been obtained
   up to date, in the present work we used crosslinking and Forster
   resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays for probing the putative
   DNA-binding center of MutL from Escherichia coli. Several
   single-cysteine MutL variants (scMutL) were used for site-specific
   crosslinking or fluorophore modification. The crosslinking efficiency
   between scMutL proteins and mismatched DNA modified with thiol-reactive
   probes correlated with the distances from the Cys residues to the DNA
   calculated from a model of MutS-MutL-DNA complex. FRET-based
   investigation of DNA binding with different scMutL variants clearly
   showed that the highest signals were detected for the variants
   MutL(T218C) and MutL(A251C) indicating closeness of the positions 218
   and 251 to DNA in the MutL-DNA complex. Indeed, the Cys218 and Cys251 of
   scMutL were crosslinked to the reactive DNA with the highest yield
   demonstrating their proximity to DNA in the MutL-DNA complex. The
   presence of MutS increased the yield of conjugate formation between the
   MutL variants and the modified DNA due to tighter MutL-DNA interactions
   caused by MutS binding to MutL. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Societe

Abstract = {{Recent advances have revealed that lncRNAs play important roles in
   tumorigenesis. However, only a small number of functional lncRNAs have
   been well characterized, particularly in colorectal cancer. Therefore,
   more extensive studies are needed to identify and characterize these
   lncRNAs to better understand cancer progression. In the present study,
   using available RNA-seq data, we found that LINC02381 (NR\_026656.1)
   differentially expresses in CRC tissues compared to normal pairs.
   Consistently, RT-qPCR results showed that LINC02381 was down regulated
   in CRC tissues and also in different cancerous cell lines. CRC cells
   treatment with de-methylating and chemotherapy agents indicated that DNA
   methylation of LINC02381 may be responsible for the transcriptional
   silencing of LINC02381 in colorectal cancer cells. Then, the functional
   changes of the cells in response to LINC02381 alteration were assessed
   and the data indicated that LINC02381 up-regulation suppressed cell
   viability and proliferation while increasing the apoptosis in
   CRC-originated cell lines. Mechanistically, LINC02381 overexpression was
   increased PTEN protein levels but decreased phospho-Akt levels. Finally,
   we proposed a hypothesized model for PI3K signaling regulation by
   LINC02381. Altogether, the result of this study suggests that LINC02381
   might have suppressive effects on human colorectal cancer tumorigenesis
   partly by regulating PI3K signaling pathway. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and

Abstract = {{Cartilage acidic protein 1 (CRTAC1) is an extracellular matrix protein
   of human chondrogenic tissue that is also present in other vertebrates,
   non-vertebrate eukaryotes and in some prokaryotes. The function of
   CRTAC1 remains unknown but the protein's structure indicates a role in
   cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions and calcium-binding. The aim of
   the present study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of hCRTAC1-A on
   normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). A battery of in vitro assays
   (biochemical and PCR), immunofluorescence and a biosensor approach were
   used to characterize the protein's biological activities on NHDF cells
   in a scratch assay. Gene expression analysis revealed that hCRTAC1-A
   protein is associated with altered levels of expression for genes
   involved in the processes of cell proliferation (CXCL12 and NOS2), cell
   migration (AQP3 and TNC), and extracellular matrix-ECM regeneration and
   remodeling (FMOD, TIMP1, FN1) indicating a role for hCRTAC1-A in
   promoting these activities in a scratch assay. In parallel, the
   candidate processes identified by differential gene transcription were
   substantiated and extended using Electric cell-substrate impedance
   sensing (ECIS) technology, immunofluorescence and cell viability assays.
   Our findings indicate that hCRTAC1-A stimulated cell proliferation,

Abstract = {{Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are phylogenetically conserved
   calcium-dependent enzymes which post-translationally convert arginine

   deimination can cause the generation of neo-epitopes, affect gene
   regulation and also allow for protein moonlighting and therefore
   facilitate multifaceted functions of the same protein. PADs are
   furthermore a key regulator of cellular release of extracellular vesicle
   (EVs), which are found in most body fluids and participate in cellular
   communication via transfer of cargo proteins and genetic material. In
   this study, post-translationally deiminated proteins and EVs were
   assessed in sera of two seal species, grey seal and harbour seal. We
   report a poly-dispersed population of serum-EVs, which were positive for
   phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers and characterised by
   transmission electron microscopy. A number of deiminated proteins
   critical for immune and metabolic functions were identified in the seal
   sera and varied somewhat between the two species under study, while some
   targets were in common. EV profiles of the seal sera further revealed
   that key microRNAs for inflammation, immunity and hypoxia also vary

Abstract = {{Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) mediate the entry of Ca2+ ions
   into cells in response to membrane depolarization and play fundamental
   roles in the nervous system, and the alpha 1 subunits are the main
   subunits of Ca2+ channels. Caenorhabditis elegans possesses genes
   encoding alpha 1 subunits; however, very few of these genes have been
   cloned in plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs). Ditylenchus destructor is a
   PPN that has been proposed as a new model for studying the biology and
   control of PPNs. To understand the structure and function of the VGCCs
   of this PPN, we first cloned and identified three full-length cDNAs of
   VGCC alpha 1 subunit genes in D. destructor with the defining structural
   and conserved features of Ca(v)1 (L-type), Ca(v)2 (non-L-type) and
   Ca(v)3 (T-type). In situ hybridization assays demonstrated that the
   Ca(v)1 VGCC alpha 1 subunit gene (DdC alpha 1D) was expressed within
   body wall muscles. The Ca(v)2 VGCC alpha 1 subunit (DdC alpha 1A) was
   expressed in the oesophageal gland, vulva and vas deferens of the worm,
   and the Ca(v)3 VGCC alpha 1 subunit (DdC alpha 1G) was localized to the
   oesophagus and median bulb. In addition, on the basis of the in vitro
   knockdown of L-, non-L- and T-type genes via RNAi, these genes were
   predicted to play a key role in the modulation of locomotion, feeding
   and reproduction. After the silencing of DdC alpha 1G, the median bulb
   muscle of D. destructor was obviously contracted, and its feeding and
   reproduction abilities were significantly inhibited. This study provides
   insight into the structure and function of VGCC alpha 1 subunits in D.
